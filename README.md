# GanttMaster - Gantt Chart Generator for EDF & RMA Algorithms ðŸŽ¯

## Overview
GanttMaster is a web-based tool designed to **generate Gantt charts** for **Earliest Deadline First (EDF)** and **Rate Monotonic Algorithm (RMA)** scheduling algorithms. It allows users to visualize scheduling decisions in real-time, making it easier to understand the behavior of both algorithms.

The project includes:
- **Front-end**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript for UI and Gantt chart generation  
- **Back-end logic**: JavaScript-based real-time scheduling algorithms (EDF & RMA)  
- **Interactive controls**: Set process arrival time with sliders and choose the number of processes dynamically.

---

## Features
- ðŸŽ› **Set Arrival Time** using an interactive **slider** for each process.
- ðŸ”¢ **Choose the Number of Processes** dynamically.
- ðŸ—“ **EDF and RMA Algorithms**: Generate real-time Gantt charts using both scheduling strategies.
- ðŸŒˆ **Color-coded Gantt Chart**: Each process block is represented with a unique color.
- ðŸ”— **Dynamic Process Visualization**: No breaks between processes in the Gantt chart.
- ðŸ•’ **Display Arrival and End Times** for each process below the chart.
- ðŸ“Š **Horizontal Gantt Chart Layout** with smooth transitions between process blocks.

## Getting Started

### Open the Project in VS Code or any IDE
1. Open the project folder in **VS Code** or any IDE of your choice.

### Launch the Application
- Simply open `index.html` in any web browser.

---

## Usage
1. Set the **number of processes** you want to visualize in the Gantt chart.
2. Use the **arrival time slider** to set individual process arrival times.
3. Choose between **EDF** or **RMA** scheduling algorithms.
4. Click **Generate Gantt Chart** to visualize the results.
5. Observe the **arrival and end times** of each process below the chart.

Known Issues
ðŸ›  No database integration: Currently, the application is entirely frontend-based.
ðŸ’¡ Algorithm performance: The chart may need optimizations for very large inputs.
Future Enhancements
Add deadline constraints for better EDF visualizations.
Implement priority inversion handling.
Export Gantt charts as PDF or PNG.
